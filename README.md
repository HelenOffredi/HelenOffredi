I'm Helen!

### 👩‍💻 About Me

***

  * A motivated and self-driven individual who is highly analytical with a passion for spotting trends and patterns and deep diving into consumer    behaviours. With a BSc in Psychology and 12 years experience as a Retail & Ecommerce Merchandiser, I have extensive experience analysing sales data, customer shopping patterns, store performance, marketing performance and competitor offerings. My primary role as a Merchandiser was to use these insights to identify growth opportunities and influence business decisions to increase profitability.

  * Building on my love for data and insights analysis, which i have previously carried out in Excel, I have spent the last few months developing my skills in this area adding SQL and Tableau to my skillset having recently completed the Datacamp SQL Fundamentals & Tableau courses.
